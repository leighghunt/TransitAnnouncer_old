# TransitAnnouncer

Audibly announce when next bus or train is arriving, for those who prefer an audio interface

Uses Metlink's [OpenData API](https://opendata.metlink.org.nz) to query for when next bus or train is arriving at nearest stop, using [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference) and [GTFS-Realtime](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/reference) feeds.
